**Geospatial Habtiat Assessment Tool (Geo-HAT)**
--version 1.0--

This workspace is used to create a geospatial database (currently only for North Carolina) to serve as the basis for a multi-critera decision analysis tool for prioritizing habitat
at the landscape scale. 

Habitat patches can be prioritized on a combination of key patch attributes groups:
- Patch size/shape
- Patch connectivty to other patches
- Patch connectivity to protected areas
- Patch vulnerability
- Patch biodiversity (actual and potential)

Each patch attribute group, in turn, has its own criteria for evalation. For example, patch size/shape can be based on patch area, core area, shape index, mean distance to edge - or any weighted combination thereof. The choices should be reflect your decision objective hierarchy and can lead to different results. 

This workspace is currently still in development. Additional questions should be directed to:
